# Understanding the dataframe variables' role in model building

Habitat: Currently I've only built models from datasets that are entirely 1-ha or CF, mainly 
because I don't have a distance value for CF plants. I suppose I could set dist_near = 500 or some similar number and then treat habitat as a categorical variable and test for significance, or I can continue to just compare outputs between the two habitat types, if appropriate.

bdffp_reserve_no - treat as categorical variable, take into account plot variation in vital rates due to things like architecture and composition of surrounding matrix.

year - categorical variable treated as a random effect in mixed effect model

dist_near and dist_next - currently treated as continuous variables, but since this dataset
simplifies the true distance to edge to be the center of the plot I wonder if treating it 
categorically is ok since the plants aren't actually taking on a full range of unique values.

dist_near and dist_next are likely correlated, how to account for this in model building?

flwr,surv - binary response variables 

size- predictor variable that is derived from ht*shts. This variable alongside growth causes
the most problems, has great variation and heavily skewed. 

fold_grwth - performs better after being log transformed and modeled with gaussian family, but still unruly. 

# How to reasonably test edge interaction?

My thoughts on this are to create a categorical variable plot_type that uses value
of dist_next and dist_near to differentiate between two types of plots: corner plots and
single-edge plots. Can then include plot_type in model building and test for improvement using 
either AIC or Anova methods. This is of course assuming that edge interaction is most likely to be detectable at a corner where two edges converge. From there we would have to interpret model output to understand the nature of the edge interaction (strengthening,weakening). 

# How to tease apart differences in flowering probability in different habitats?

On Eric's poster I saw he mentioned that CF flowering probability was higher due to there
being more large plants inside CF that were more likely to flower. Is there a way to control 
for this discrepancy in size demographics between the habitat types, or should we even do that? I suppose the problem is that I don't know if the differences in flowering probability is due to demographic differences in size, edge effects that may impact size, or some combination of both. 

# Determining magnitude and DOI of edge effects

Currently using point of overlap of 84% CIs with upper-bound of CF to determine the 
DOI. This method doesn't seem to work if there is no overlap between the two (estimates for CF and FF never overlap w/ varying distance.)
